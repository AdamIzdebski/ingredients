Description: Collection of tools for assessment of feature importance and feature effects.
    Key functions are: `feature_importance()` for assessment 
    of batch level feature importance, `ceteris_paribus()` for the what-if analysis. 
    It creates Ceteris Paribus profiles, `aggregate_profiles()` and `cluster_profiles()` for aggregation 
    of Ceteris Paribus profiles. This way you can calculate Partial Dependency Profiles,
    Accumulated Local Effects Profiles and much more.
